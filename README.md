# H1 - 7SnakeProblem

Project
======

To solve the problem, the technique was used Brute-force. Where a thread with random initial positions is initialized and which snake is found to have a smaller size (the size considered in this case is the sum of the elements). The algorithm only ends when no solution is found, in which case a "fail" message will be displayed to the user. If the algorithm finds some solution the solution will be shown in the console with the step by step taken by each snake until arriving at the solution found and also the value of the sum of the houses will be displayed.

Getting Started
